## Object.entries

This is a polyfill for the [Object.values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/values) function from the ECMAScript 8

## Why Another One?

Because of the already writtern polyfills are too complicated and I wanted something simpler and doesn't relys on other new prototypes!.

## Usage
You can install it with npm
```
npm install --save object_values
```

Or just [download it manually](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KhaledElAnsari/Object.values/master/index.js) and add it to your project

## License
